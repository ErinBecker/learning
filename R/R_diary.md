# R Diary

January 9, 2017

I've used R informally since 2010, but would like to be a lot more fluent. I can usually manage to do the things I want to do in R, but 
I still find myself taking a lot longer than I want to to do relatively simple things (and usually doing them less elegantly than I would like).

I recently started using [Data Camp](www.datacamp.com) to learn R more systematically and expand my capabilities. This "R Diary" is for me
to keep track of my progress, take notes on some things I've learned, and celebrate being able to do things with less headache!
