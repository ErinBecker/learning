# Random Things I Would Like to Accomplish

- Create a personal website  
- Write an R package for "synonymizing" - take input text and replace each word with first synonym in thersaurus (does this already exist?)
- Create a lesson for something I know about using the [Software Carpentry Lesson Template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example) and publish on my personal website
