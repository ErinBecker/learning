Random thoughts on possible collaboration with [Nick Veldhuis](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~veldhuis/), prof of Assyriology at UCB. 
Chated at Reproducible Research for Jupyter Notebooks Hackathon yesterday and he showed me some cool work he's doing playing with textual 
analysis of ancient Semetic texts. He's exploring using distance matrices to investigate relationships among texts. This work may benefit from
looking at existing distance matrices as used for phylogenetics, or possibly other textual processing work in R. Gabe mentioned previous work
on textual distance analysis in R. Need to look into the details. This could potentially be a really fun collaboration!
